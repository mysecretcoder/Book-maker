11/01/2000   Version 2.8.0
 - changed comments in pgsql create file to -- as
   suggested by jlc6@po.cwru.edu
 - changed public to public_f in bkshared.inc
 - fixed handling of user_total_bookmarks.
   NOTE: if upgrading, make sure and delete all rows
   in active_sessions table to allow this fix to work!
   (thanks to gburca@yahoo.com)
 - fixed sort/control-break logic in list pages to use
   category/subcat names, not IDs to support viewing
   bookmarks from multiple users
   (thanks to yamamoto@trustbee.com)
 - fixed delete logic in codes.php3 to correctly update
   bookmark table
   (thanks to yamamoto@trustbee.com)
       
08/10/2000   Version 2.7.0
 - removed guest user settings. now using PHPLIB default
   authentication to handle public access.

07/17/2000   Version 2.6.0

   handle ampersands properly
   you'll want to update your quik-mark and mail-this-link bookmarks
   in your browser!
 - fixed refresh/cache issues with MSIE and Netscape on the tree
   view page (I hope!). It still is not 100% correct. It all works
   better if you are logged in before you attempt to go to the tree
   view page.
 - fixed quote handling on search page as suggested by
   seva@rubis.lod.com
 - added ODBC/MS Sql Server support as patched by 
   seva@rubis.lod.com

07/06/2000   Version 2.5.0
 - changed default code names from "unassigned" and "not rated"
   to "--"
 - added links to edit codes from maintain and create pages.
 - enhanced import page to look for existing category and
   subcategory before adding a new one. This will allow you
   to import mutliple files/times without getting duplicate
   categories or subcategories. Note the duplicate check for
   bookmarks was already coded.

06/29/2000   Version 2.4.0
 - changed from FastTemplates to PHPLIB's template class
 - changed method by which db callout is instantiated
   to make installation easier. Encouraged by idea from
   javaman@vnet.net

06/13/2000   Version 2.3.0
 - fixed column name bug, uid, in user.php3
 - changed to not use include_path anymore since it
   causes much confusion and problems for people.
   Using define() globals now.
 - from jeferee@pobox.com: user page now adds ratings
   and uses nextid function for bookmark insert.
 - removed reliance on .htaccess file for settings.
   trying to make installation and use easier for the
   not technie user. added checks to index page to test
   for proper php settings.

04/12/yyyy   Version 2.2.0
 - upgraded to PHPLIB 7.2b which is supposedly PHP4 compat.
   small change required to auth_user for this PHPLIB upgrade,
   see alter-2.2.0.sql.
 - applied PHP4 related changes from <toby.cabot@pobox.com>
 - fixed maillink sql bug identified by <toby.cabot@pobox.com>
 - changed all auto_increment db columns to use PHPLIB db_sequence
   and nextid functionality. this makes the db code more generic.
 - added note to import page about MSIE export feature.
 - first attempt at PostgreSQL support by adding database callout
   class and functions to separate database specific code from
   the main code base.
 - moved all alter and db create scripts to ./lib/db/

03/24/2000   Version 2.1.0
 - changed name of column bookmark.public to bookmark.public_f
   to better support other databases like postgres.
 - to bookmarker.inc added db_first_row_offset to support use
   of OFFSET, LIMIT SQL in other databases like postgres.
 - import now lists all folder levels from input file in the
   keyword column to facilitate searching since only 2 folder
   levels are directly supported in the db.
 - added WAP/WML sample page that displays public WML bookmarks
 - when a cat/subcat is deleted, bookmarks of the cat/subcat
   are assigned to cat/subcat 0.
 - disallow delete of cat/subcat 0 to support above.
 - fix wording of cat/subcat/rating section to refer to user
   preferences page
 - add BIG_TABLES db option to plist before main query.
   this is MySQL specific, sorry.
 - logout link only shows when user is logged in
 - logout process redirects user back to start page - no need
   for logout.body.tpl any longer


01/23/2000   Version 2.0.2
 - fixed bad auth_user update sql in alter-2.0.0.sql and bookmarker.sql.
   this was causing more than one auth_user row to have the same 
   perm_auth_cookie value, which could enable someone to login as
   another user. See UPGRADE for info on how to fix this.
 - changed composition of cookie to include user ID and be base_64
   encoded before it is sent to the browser.
 - added perm_cookie_lifetime to bookmarker.inc
 - added GIF version of all images. Test user-agent, and if known
   5.0 or later browser, show PNG image, otherwise show the GIF image.
 - added test in user page to make sure user ID matches [A-Za-Z0-9]
   
01/17/2000   Version 2.0.1
 - fixed bad create/insert sql in bookmarker.sql

01/16/2000   Version 2.0.0
 - split mailing lists. Now all discussion is on bookmarker, and
   bookmarker-announce will be announcements only.
 - track date that bookmark was added (new bookmark.added field)
 - fixed bug on mail-this-link that could cause site footer to be added multiple times
 - added graphics from tigert.gimp.org/ from gnome-stock
 - added .int as valid top-level domain (TLD) #114
 - added option on login to store auth as a permanent cookie
   on the local browser. this allows you to bypass the login
   on subsequent logins - ONLY set this when logging in via a
   secure machine. You'll need to update the user record before
   using this feature in order to set the perm_auth_cookie column
   for each user.
 - changed to use only .png graphics
 - implemented public/private security for bookmarks. each bookmark is
   set to either public or private. each user has a default private/public
   status used for the create page. each user can say if they want to
   see public bookmarks in their list/search, or just their own stuff.
 - user page has option to set all bookmarks to private or public for a
   user.
 - guest user now just like any other, guest user sees all public
   bookmarks from any other users.
 - cleanup error msg and db error handling
 - auto redirect back to list/search after maintain
 - users can now only see their own user record, and can update their
   own user record (except for permissions)
 - more fixes to support PHPLIB GET session mode
 - display name of currently logged in user
 - store date each bookmark was added
 - new netscape import PAGE! (look under user preferences)
 
08/20/1999   Version 1.6
 - updated to PHPLIB version 7
 - bug 96: fixed image paths in all pages, also changed default
   image_url_prefix in bookmarker.inc
   

07/08/1999   Version 1.5
 - added DTDs to common.standard.tpl and tree.body.tpl
 - changed definition of javascript blocks to be HTML 4.0 std
 - added proper HTML comments to hide Javascript from non-JS
   browsers
 - added ALT attributes to IMG tags in tree view
 - added optional keyword field to bookmarker table 
   (changes from Keith Amidon <camalot@picnicpark.org>)
 - changed layout of list page to show keywords and be more
   compact (changes from Keith Amidon <camalot@picnicpark.org>)
 - upgraded to FastTemplate version 1.1
 - added ability to save searches. also search page now defaults
   to last search during a session.
   (idea from Keith Amidon <camalot@picnicpark.org>)
 - the search page now accepts a where clause in the URL. if
   specified it will be used
 - the category/subcat headers in the list/search page are now
   anchor tags that take you to the search page to find matches
   on the cat or subcat
 - added ability to show search results in the tree view.
   (idea from Keith Amidon <camalot@picnicpark.org>)
 - added ability to select saved searches from tree view
   (idea from Keith Amidon <camalot@picnicpark.org>)
 - added tree view option to control cat/subcat grouping
   (idea from Keith Amidon <camalot@picnicpark.org>)
 - added tree view option in bookmarker.inc to determine if
   bookmarker pages are shown in tree view list
 - added Javascript reload link to tree view page. doesn't work in
    MSIE.

 
06/13/1999   Version 1.4
 - bug 65: added image_url_prefix setting to bookmarker.inc. Changed
   all templates to use this variable before the image filename.
 - bug 67: added scrollbars to popup quik-mark and mail-this-link 
   windows. resized those same windows to better fit - note the 
   sizes are HIGHLY dependent on your screen resolution - see 
   FAQ for info on how to customize these settings.
 - bug 64: conditionally hide first/last on the list page just like
   prev/next
 - fixed title text in header block - every page said "start"! :-(
 - bug 71: changed all htmlentities calls to htmlspecialchars calls
   to better support non-english character sets
 - bug 69: added url_format_check option in bookmarker.inc to give
   the installer control over URL format checking in maintain and 
   create pages. changed validator class to check if all numeric
   hostname - if so, call is_ipaddress function, otherwise call
   normal is_hostname function. also submitted this change to 
   thewebasters.net to see if they want to change their version.
 - added a perl/dbi/dbd/cgi script to verify bookmarks. this was more
   an excuse for me to learn these perl modules. you can use it if
   you like. I run this about once every few months by hand. see
   vbk.pl and vbk.sh for more info.
 - bug 72: changed description field on maintain and create pages
   to be multi line textarea form field. added nl2br call in plist.inc
   to properly display the line breaks.
   
04/25/1999   Version 1.3
 - fixed special character handling. when data from FORM field
   loaded into db, data is passed through addslashes(). When
   data read from db that was addslashed, the data is passed
   through stripslashes, and if that data is destined for an HTML
   page it is further passed through htmlentities().
 - to support above, and give bookmarker full control over
   character handling, bookmarker now requires magic_quotes_gpc
   and magic_quotes_runtime to be OFF. See INSTALL file for more
   info. 
 - added javascript to login page (like create and maillink) to make
   login pop to front when used by quik-mark or mail-this-link
 - made permissions field on create user a select list
 - changed authentication to try to use PHPLIB challenge-response
   authentication using javascript. The challenge-response auth
   avoids sending the password in plain text over the net. If user
   does not have Javascript enabled, then the old style auth is used.
 - changed the way passwords are stored in the user database. Now the
   password is encrypted with the PHP md5 function before being stored.
   this is to make it work with the challenge-response auth, as well
   as be a little more portable than the previous use of the MySQL
   password() function. All existing user passwords will need to be
   updated - use the update-1.3.sql to get you started - read the
   INSTALL file for detailed upgrade instructions.
 - fixed sql bug in list.php3 (bug 59)
 - added trim function for most form input fields (bug 60)
 - slightly modified Sql_Query form function in bklocal.inc to match
   the changed version I committed to PHPLIB for PHPLIB 7.x
 - added support for multiple to addresses on the mail-this-link page
 - changed list page to work based on limit and offset, also added
   vcr buttons and links. this takes better advantage of the db and
   makes more general sense. (bug 61) this includes two new PHPLIB
   user variables - user_total_bookmarks and user_last_page.
 
04/13/1999   Version 1.2
 - upgraded to FastTemplate version 0.8 (inc. fixes for Windows)
 - added note to INSTALL file for Windows users
 - fixed bookmarker heading in tree.body.tpl
 - removed maintain link under bookmarker heading in tree.body.tpl
 - fixed create possible dup check to include username match in
   WHERE clause
 - modified create possible dup check to execute whenever a URL is
   found, not just after quik-mark
 - changed wording and HTML slightly in create.possible_dup.tpl
 - changed possible dup check lookup logic to be scheme (http://)
   + hostname (www.mydomain.com) + $bookmarker->possible_dup_chars
   of path. possible_dup_chars now defaults to zero in bookmarker.inc
 - search: added ID as allowed search field
   
04/12/1999   Version 1.1
 - added FastTemplate class from http://www.thewebmasters.net/php/
 - Full FastTemplate support to allow total interface customization for
   local installations.
 - Tested with PHP 3.0.7
 - Tested with Apache 1.3.6
 - Removed maintain link from header of each page. It didn't really make
   sense since you can't go to the maintain without being in the context
   of a bookmark, so clicking on the maintain link in the header would
   NEVER get you in maintain mode for a bookmark.
 - added mail-this-link page to allow you to send an email to someone
   telling them about a link that they might be interested in. This 
   required two new fields on the auth_user table
 - restructured the bookmarker distribution web site on renaghan.com
   to better separate the renaghan.com bookmarker installation from the
   bookmarker software home page and distribution
 - removed source page from website. with FastTemplates, bookmarker
   has too many source files. keeping the download page up to date is
   a pain.
 - added function to check for possible duplicates on create page when
   called from quik-mark
 
03/27/1999   Version 1.0
 - added Validator class from http://www.thewebmasters.net/php/Validator.phtml
 - changed bugs.php3 and maillist.php3 to use email check from Validator
   class
 - changed create.php3 and maintain.php3 to check URL format using 
   Validator class and to give a warning message if the URL does not
   respond using a function in the Validator class.
 - changed create.php3 to properly default fields given quik-mark function, 
   and to not clear fields when validation error ocurrs, and to not clear
   fields after a sucessful create.
 - MS Internet Explorer has a buggy implementation of Javascript
   (big shocker!) that prevents the quik-mark popup window from coming
   to the top when it is opened. Therefore in the commonHeader function
   I added code that if the browser is MSIE it runs a Javascript command
   to bring the current page up to the front. I hate nothing more than
   coding conditions based on the browser type, but I figured the quik-
   mark function was worth it.
 - updated Validator class to version 1.2 - changed text of email error
   messages.
 - added error message from Validator class for addl info
 - added logic in maintain to display same data user entered when
   page re-displayed after an error
 - added Install FAQ section to INSTALL file
 - added dist_site variable to bookmarker.inc to control display of
   distribution site only related links in the footer

   are printed on each "plain list" page

   bookmarks right from their web browser. see faq.
 - added faq page - so far info on quik-mark only
 - added faq link to std header

02/27/1999 Version 0.9
 - added ID to maintain page
 - removed help text from tree page - this will be replaced by full
   user documentation
 - added URL as TITLE attribute for links in tree view. this allows user
   to hold mouse over link and see the URL before they open the link 
   (note: TITLE attribute is not supported by all browsers)
 - added "other bookmarks tools" section to start page
 - removed $sess as parameter from common_hdr and common_footer functions.
   those functions now declare $sess as global. also modified set_bk_username
   to do the same with $sess and $auth.
 - new file: bookmarker.inc. this file contains the configuration settings
   class used for bookmarker. update the variables in this class to control
   how the application looks and functions.
 - created quick-and-dirty shell scripts to parse netscape bookmarks.html file
   and prepare SQL statements to load into bookmarker database. not really
   clean or commented, but should provide enough of a start for most people
   to convert their bookmarks. see scripts named ns_convert*.
 - cleaned up login form. removed "warning..." since I can't recreate that
   bug anymore.

12/29/1998 Version 0.8
 - added user maintain page (user.php3)
 - added single page to maintain data in category, sub-category, and
   rating tables (codes.php3)

   databases

12/16/1998 Version 0.7
 - added INSTALL file
 - modifications to allow tree.php3 to be cached locally by the browser.
   This dramatically improves the performance of the tree view.
   this involved overriding the page_open() and start() functions of 
   the PHPLIB session object. I am in discussions with the PHPLIB folks
   to decide how to correctly implement these changes in my app or the
   library itself.
 - added alt tags to images on index.php3 page
 - fixed search to use child table name fields instead of id fields
 - changed query in plist to join with rating table for above

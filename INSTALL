These instructions assume that you have the following working
together: Web Server, PHP, and database. I recommend the
following configuration:

- Apache Web Server (http://www.apache.org/). I recommend downloading
the source and compiling it yourself so that you can compile PHP as
an Apache module. NOTE: The RPM or other binary version should work
as well.

- PHP (http://www.php.net/). Again I recommend downloading the source
and compiling it yourself so that you can compile PHP as an Apache
module. NOTE: bookmarker should also work using PHP as a CGI
executable either compiled yourself or from a binary distribution of
PHP.

- MySQL (http://www.mysql.net/). You can either compile the source,
or in my case I downloaded the binary RPMs from the MySQL website.
Either should work.

- PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org). Others have tested and have
had success using bookmarker with PostgreSQL.

- ODBC/Microsoft SQL Server. Others have tested and have had success using
bookmarker with MS SQL Server.

--
bookmarker installation
(after untar/unzip the distribution file to a temporary location...)

PLEASE READ THE UPGRADE FILE INCLUDED IN THE DISTRIBUTION
IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF BOOKMARKER.

1. Move the bookmarker directory that was created by the un-tar/un-zip to
a location under your webserver's document root - so that the
web server will serve the bookmarker pages.

2. Tell your webserver NOT TO SERVE pages in the bookmarker/lib directory.
These pages contain the user ID and password to your database and
you don't want folks seeing them. I have included an .htaccess
file in this directory for use by Apache that will stop browsing
of the lib directory. Make sure and test this after the installation
by trying to get to http://your-domain.com/bookmarker/lib/bklocal.inc
You should NOT be able to get to this URL.

3. Update the bklocal.inc file with the name of your bookmarker
database and the user ID and password used to connect to it. I use
"bookmarks" as the name of my bookmarker database. Review the
contents of this file and update to support the database you are
using. 

4. Update the bookmarker.inc file with the configuration settings
for your environment.

5. If you are using PostgreSQL, update the bkprepend.inc file to
comment the include of db_mysql and un-comment the include of db_pgsql.
   If you are using an ODBC database like MS SQL Server, update the 
bkprepend.inc file to comment the include of db_mysql and un-comment 
the include of db_odbc.

OPTIONAL: 
  Full customization is available with the template support in bookmarker.
Update the files in the bookmarker/lib/templates directory to create the 
look & feel and language that you desire for your installation of bookmarker.

6. Create a database for bookmarker (e.g., "bookmarks"), then 
create the tables in the database used by bookmarker
using the ./lib/db/create_db.[your database] definition. 
In MySQL this can be done
(assuming you have created a database named "bookmarks") with the
following command:
  mysql bookmarks <./lib/db/create_db.mysql

7. create_db.* script creates a sample user with sample
bookmarks to get you up and running quickly. The user ID of the
sample user is "bk" and the password is "bk". Additional users can be
added to bookmarker using the user page. Users with update rights need to
have "editor" in the perms column of auth_user. "editor" permission
allows a user to add/update/delete/select bookmarks, "guest" allows
select only, and "admin" allows same as "editor" plus being able to
add/update/delete/maintain bookmarker users.

8. Open the index.php3 page in your browser, click the "List View"
link on the top of the start page, enter "bk" in the user ID field,
enter "bk" in the password field, click "Login" button, and enjoy!

9. Use the Import Bookmarks page under User Preferences to import
your Netscape Bookmarks file into bookmarker.

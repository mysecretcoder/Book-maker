-- bookmarker UPGRADE Instructions --
** Database alter scripts are located in ./lib/db/ **
---------------------
Version 2.2.0:
Apply alter-2.2.0.sql to your database (instructions are inside
this file.)
Database column(s) have been renamed per PHPLIB 7.2b upgrade.
New database sequence table created.
*** YOU MUST update the bookmark and search rows in db_sequence
    to the (max(id)+1)) in the respective table. Otherwise, you

    search table.
***

---------------------
Version 2.1.0:
Database column(s) have been renamed to better support other
databases like postgres.

---------------------
Version 2.0.2:
Fixed bad auth_user update sql in alter-2.0.0.sql and bookmarker.sql.
this was causing more than one auth_user row to have the same 
perm_auth_cookie value, which could enable someone to login as
another user. Run alter-2.0.2.sql against your databse to ensure
this is fixed. This will reset all perm_auth_cookie values to a 
unique value for every row in auth_user and will require that
you login to get the new cookie value for your user.

---------------------
Version 2.0.0:
Starting with this version, bookmarker is distributed
with a functional version of PHPLIB 7 included in ./lib/phplib.
There is no longer any need to setup/update/configure PHPLIB for use
with bookmarker. The normal bookmarker installation will take care of this.

New database columns have been added to support new features. Run
the alter-2.0.0.sql script to update it.

---------------------
Version 1.6 - Starting with this version, bookmarker works with
PHPLIB version 7 only. Please upgrade your PHPLIB installation
before upgrading to bookmarker version 1.6.

---------------------
Version 1.5 adds a keyword field to the database and the ability to save
searches in the database. A new field on the bookmark table and a new
search table are needed. Run the alter-1.5.sql script against your
bookmarker database to update it.

---------------------
Version 1.3 now encrypts user password using the built-in PHP md5 function
instead of using the MySQL password() function. Therefore ALL existing
user passwords must have their passwords updated to the md5 version.
Included in the dist is the update-1.3.sql file. This will allow you
to set the password for the admin user to "bk" so that you can login
to bookmarker and change the passwords for all users - just use the
user.php3 page and enter in the passwd for each user, this will 
automatically update it to the new md5 encrypted version.

---------------------
Version 1.1 adds two new fields to the auth_user table. Please read and
apply the contents of the alter-1.1.sql file to bring your database
up to date. You will also want to populate these new fields in the 
auth_user table (name, email) so that the mail-this-link function works
properly.

---------------------
If you are running a version of bookmarker older than version 0.8,
please read and apply the contents of the alter-0.8.sql file to
bring your database up to the version that 0.8 requires.
